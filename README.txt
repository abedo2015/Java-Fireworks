The program is gui based. You will be shown a gui containing two options.

1. For multiple explosion
2. For two projectiles thrown towards each other

You have to enter an angle, a speed, starting x and y position(according to instructions given in gui).
If you wish to add or remove fireworks, simply press the plus and minus buttons provided to you on the gui.

After pressing show button you will be shown results
1. For multiple explosion, fireworks will explode
2. For two projectiles, where the projectiles will hit each other that portion will be highlighted. (However, I had difficulty getting the
   Y-coordinate to properly get into position... However, the x-axis will follow accordingly.)

Furthermore, if the user selects the "break" option, the firework will break into several smaller smaller projectiles.

You can enter details and view results as many times as you like!
Please note, the result is best seen if the window is maximized however you can resize window.

I couldn't figure out how to properly implement the user color input so I made everything go random instead. 


If you are having difficulty opening the project, go to...
File -> New -> Java Project
Uncheck "Use Default Location" and click on browse. double click the FireWorks folder to select it. 
Once you are back to the New Java Project page, click "Next" on the bottom and make sure that "Allow output folders for source folders" is unchecked
and you should be good to go.
